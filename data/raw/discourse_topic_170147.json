I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project.

ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard.
