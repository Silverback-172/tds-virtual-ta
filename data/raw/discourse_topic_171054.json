We also tested it with our friends’ GA questions, and it’s working as expected. This project was a team effort by me and two friends [ @lakshaygarg654 and @23f2004637 ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment. I would love the opportunity to demonstrate our project to TA and Anand Sir in a Google Meet session on March 31st (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th).
